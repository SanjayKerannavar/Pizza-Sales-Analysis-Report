## Problem Statement

The Pizza Sales Analysis Report is designed to provide key insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and product demand across different pizza categories and sizes. By analyzing sales data, this report aims to help the business optimize its offerings, boost sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The report focuses on identifying critical metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and the number of orders, which are essential for evaluating overall business performance. Furthermore, it highlights trends in sales over time, segmented by day and month, to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior.

In addition to these KPIs, the report also provides a breakdown of sales by pizza category and size, allowing the business to assess the contribution of each product line to the overall revenue. The analysis of best and worst-selling pizzas, based on revenue, quantity, and number of orders, offers valuable insights into customer preferences and product performance.

By visualizing these metrics and trends, the Pizza Sales Analysis Report serves as a powerful tool for decision-makers to identify areas of improvement, adjust pricing or marketing strategies, and cater to customer demand more effectively.
